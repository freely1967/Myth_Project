HELLO people 


So I thought, the idea was that our current UI is super crowded and not really user-friendly. So I thought to myself, maybe I can start with the UI. But to really get into it and dive deep into the UI, I needed to change the CSV file, because the one we had was super complicated to use with a graph database.

So I made a Python script that converted it into two simpler CSV files. I made one file for the nodes and one for the relationships. Then I started adding them into a real graph database. I uploaded them online to DataBank, grabbed the raw file from there, and put it on GitHub so I could use it without license issues.

I used that GitHub DataBank in my project, wrote a new Python script, and tried to build a graph database with it. I used the Cypher language in Neo4j, and honestly I had a lot of trouble using it but I finally made it. Now we have a graph database that’s really easy to edit and work with.

Then I started working on defining the structure of the graph. I made the graph database and manually added all the queries for the nodes and relationships between everything, because that part wasn’t in the original data. It was more complicated.

After that, I exported the graph database. I got the API of that graph and used it to create the Jarvis part. We should take that graph database and connect it to the website.

After fixing some website errors, I started editing the UI. Now, on the website, you can choose the number of nodes, search for something, filter the relationships, basically everything you’d need. I think it’s already more than enough for what we need in this project.

So feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.
